            To start, lean back your head, buttocks pressing a wall, relax your shoulders, and widen your feet apart.<br>
            
            Steps:<br>
            
           <br> Stand with your back against the wall. Bring your feet in the front, away from the wall.
            <br>Now slowly drop your waist, so that your thighs are parallel to the floor, as if you are sitting on an invisible chair.
            <br>Raise your hands above the head and rest them against the wall. Now slowly pull them down on either side of your head, like you would during a shoulder-press. Repeat for 10 counts.
            <br>This exercise is helpful in stabilising your spine and lower abdomen when you experience a back ache.

            3. Clam Shell
            <br>Start by lying on the floor by your side with flexed knees and an arm below your head and the other supporting your body by touching the ground. Keep your heels one on top of another.
            
            <br>Steps:
            
            <br>Press your heels together and elevate your leg to the maximum possible height.
            <br>Pause for a second and then return to the starting position. Repeat for five counts
            <br>Repeat on the other side.
            <br>This exercise helps tone the muscles, abs, thighs, buttocks and pelvic floor. As your tummy grows through pregnancy, it is advised to do this exercise with the back against the wall.
