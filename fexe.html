        Food to Eat in First Trimester of Pregnancy
Pregnant women need about 300 calories extra in addition to their normal food intake. Complex carbohydrates like whole grain bread, pasta, vegetables, beans, and legumes need to be consumed on a regular basis. A good amount of fluids and fiber must also figure in your daily diet when pregnant. The following are some other foods that should become part of your diet during this important phase of life.
<br>
1. Vegetables<br>
It is important to have around three to five servings of vegetables of various colours. Spinach is a rich source of folic acid so you should try to include it in your daily diet. Broccoli has high iron content which helps in formation of red blood cells in the baby during the first trimester. Green peas, tomatoes, red, green, and yellow bell peppers, asparagus, and sweet potatoes are all recommended for the first trimester.
<br>
2. Fruits<br>
The recommended amount of fruits for pregnant first trimester is at least three servings per day. Citrus fruits are a good source of folic acid, so try to eat grapefruits, oranges, and sweet limes on a regular basis. Avocados, bananas, pears, cantaloupes, cherries, grapes, guavas, apples, watermelons, pomegranates, and mangoes are some other fruits to include in your diet.
<br>
3. Non-Vegetarian Food<br>
When deciding on the type of non-vegetarian food for first trimester diet, you can include warm chicken soup, eggs, and lean meats. Be sure to eat well-cooked poultry and meats to prevent any digestive issues and bacterial infections. Fish is rich in omega 3 fatty acids but avoid deep sea fishes like King Mackerel, shrimp, shark, and sword fish which tend to have high mercury content.
<br>
4. Dairy Products<br>
When aiming for the required three portions of dairy per day, you can choose cottage cheese as it is a good source of not just protein but also calcium which is essential for bone and muscle development. Yoghurt, curd, low fat milk, and different varieties of cheese can be consumed during the first trimester.
<br>
5. Whole Grains<br>
Whole wheat, oats, barley, corn, millet, and rice are some whole grains to include in your first trimester diet. Lentils in the form of soup or cutlets can be made part of your diet during pregnancy. Grains provide energy to your baby and are essential for the growth of the placenta.
<br>
6. Protein<br>
See that you get at least two servings of proteins per day. Eggs are a rich source of protein alongside dairy products like cottage cheese. So are fish, meats, nuts, poultry, milk, and peanut butter.
<br>
7. Other Foods<br>
Feeling nauseous or having morning sickness is likely to last through the first trimester. So, you might also want to keep some stomach-friendly food items handy such as ginger ale, crackers, pretzels, and flavored popsicles.
