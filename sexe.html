            In your second trimester (14 weeks to 27 weeks) calcium, vitamin D and magnesium are especially important. 
        <br>
            Though a varied, healthy diet, and a vitamin D supplement, should supply you with enough of these nutrients, click through to see calcium and magnesium-rich foods you can try.
    <br>
    Glass of milk<br>
A glass of semi-skimmed milk is packed with calcium and magnesium. If you don't eat dairy products, you should have calcium-fortified soya foods, such as soya yoghurts. 
<br>
Canned sardines<br>
Mash canned sardines, including the soft, edible bones, on a slice of wholegrain toast. Or mix through spaghetti with a little parmesan and pine nuts for extra magnesium and iron. 
<br>
Baked potato with beans<br>
A jacket potato with baked beans makes a magnesium, iron and fibre-rich meal. Magnesium is important for bone development and helps your body to convert food into energy. 
<br>
A variety of vegetables<br>
Incorporate vegetables that contain magnesium and calcium such as broccoli, green beans, carrots, cabbage and okra into your meals. Stir-fry or steam to retain the nutrients, and try not to overcook them.       
<br>
Sunflower and pumpkin seeds<br>
A small handful or sunflower seeds of pumpkin seeds, whether as a snack to nibble, or added to yoghurt and salads, will give you a magnesium, iron and omega-3 boost.
<br>
Dried fruit<br>
Dried fruit such as apricots, dates and figs contain calcium and iron, and are a great snack to have stashed in your desk. Or add some chopped to low-fat yoghurt.
