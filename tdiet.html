            1. Opening Hips<br>
            Begin by standing straight with feet at shoulder width distance.
            <br>
            Steps:
            <br>
            <br>Flexing your knees perform a simple squat.
            <br>Relax your pelvic region.
            <br>Breathe deep at least five times while you squat.
            <br>Gradually get back to starting position.
            <br><br>2. Pelvic Stretches
            <br>Exercising the pelvic floor muscles is essential when you are preparing from labour. Kegel exercises for normal delivery focus on strengthening the pelvic floor muscles. To isolate and exercise these muscles, try stopping the flow of urine without using your abdominal muscles, thighs or buttocks. For slow Kegel exercises, start by sitting with a straight back comfortably on the workout ball.
            <br><br>3. Yoga
            <br>Yoga during pregnancy for normal delivery is highly recommended for expecting mothers and there are plenty of forms and aasanas that can help increase the flexibility and endurance in an expecting mother
            <br><br>4. Squat
            <br>Squats are important as they help in the contraction and loosening of the pelvic muscle and help reduce delivery pain. Taking position with the support of a gym ball or holder, will give a good pressure to the pelvic area and thighs.
